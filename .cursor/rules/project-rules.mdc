Consult README.md for a high level project overview.

Consult notion_api.yml for help in writing functions that need to connect to the Notion API (note: this file is large).

Adhere to existing code patterns and usages, and write clean and efficient code.

If you generate code as part of a step that ends up becoming unused, please remove it.

For Python logging, use logger.info instead of print.

Stay focused on your current task -- do not modify parts of the codebase that are not relevant to your task.
